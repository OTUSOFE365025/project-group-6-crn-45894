|UC-1 | **Query chatbot for information**                                   | Student inputs a request via text or voice input. Chatbot deciphers what language the student is using and what they are asking. The system then generates a response in the same language based on stored knowledge and live data.                                                  |
|UC-2 | **Post content or material**                                      | Lecturer posts course materials, content, or announcements through the chatbot. The student can then access the posted content, material, or announcements.                                                                                                                    |

|UC-4 | **View personalized analytical statistics**                       | - The student or lecturer requests dashboard statistics, which the system provides based on their role<br>    <br>- Students get student-based information such as performance indicators<br>    <br>- Lecturers get lecturer-appropriate information such as class engagement |
|UC-5 | **Integrate and configure external systems with the chatbot<br>** | System administrators manage external system integration, as well as establish global policies related to data retention.                                                                                                                                                  |
|UC-6 | **Monitor and maintain system health<br>**                        | System maintainer updates the chatbot system using a pipeline system to ensure zero downtime within the system.
