|UC-1 | **Query chatbot for information**                                   | Student inputs a request via text or voice input. Chatbot deciphers what language the student is using and what they are asking. The system then generates a response in the same language based on stored knowledge and live data.                                                  |

The student can then access the posted content, material, or announcements.                                                                                                                    |
