| **Student queries chatbot for information**                                | Student inputs a request via text or voice input. Chatbot deciphers what language the student is using and what they are asking. The system then generates a response in the same language based on stored knowledge and live data.                                                  |
| **Post content or material**                                      | Lecturer posts course materials, content, or announcements through the chatbot. The student can then access the posted content, material, or announcements.                                                                                                                    |

| **View personalized analytical statistics**                       | - The student or lecturer requests dashboard statistics, which the system provides based on their role<br>    <br>- Students get student-based information such as performance indicators<br>    <br>- Lecturers get lecturer-appropriate information such as class engagement |
| **Integrate and configure external systems with the chatbot<br>** | System administrators can manage external system integration, as well as establish global policies related to data retention.                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Monitor and maintain system health<br>**                        | System maintainer updates the chatbot system using a pipeline system to ensure zero downtime within the system. The system maintainer can then view monitoring dashboards to ensure the system is healthy with the new software<br>                                            |
