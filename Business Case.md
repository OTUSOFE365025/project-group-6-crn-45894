The university wants to implement an AI assistant platform to help the university staff and students easily access the services offered by the LMS. The AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP) is an AI-powered chatbot designed to streamline this process, involving academic and administrative tasks. The platform will be designed as a central conversational interface, providing students, instructors, and system administrators a convenient method for interacting with the LMS.
The AI assistant is designed to provide a maintainable and scalable system to help users efficiently utilize the LMS services. By allowing users to retrieve information, manage course content, and carry out system operations through the chatbot interface, it seeks to provide users with a simplified, accessible interface to reduce the effort usually needed to perform common administrative and academic tasks.
The long term goal is for the platform to support the universityâ€™s goals of system scalability and accessibility for its users, developing a more connected and responsive academic environment for all stakeholders.
